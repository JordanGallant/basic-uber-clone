# Uber Clone
This basic uber clone is a simple tool int the CLI that is able to retrieve the exact longiute and lattitude co-ordinates of the pick-up location and the drop off location, the app then can work out the exact distance(As the crow flies)
Then the app will work out the price based on the type of ride the user chose and the distance from the points
